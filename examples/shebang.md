# Runme Language Support

By default Runme can run everything that is also installed on your machine.
Read more in our [docs](https://docs.runme.dev/features#interpreter)

## Like Python:

```py
print("Hello Pythonista üêç")
```

## maybe Ruby?

```rb
puts "Hello Ruby ‚ô¶Ô∏è"
```

## or JavaScript:

```js
console.log("Always bet on JS!")
```

## even TypeScript:

Make sure you have `ts-node` installed globally:

```sh
npm i -g ts-node
```

then run:

```ts
const myVar: string = 'I am a typed string!'
console.log(myVar)
```

## and, of course, PHP

Be sure to have the `php` interpreter in your `$PATH`:

```php { interpreter=php }
<?php
$greeting = "Hello, World!";
$currentDateTime = date('Y-m-d H:i:s');

// Concatenate the greeting with the current date and time
$fullGreeting = $greeting . " It's now " . $currentDateTime . "\n";

echo $fullGreeting;
?>
```
