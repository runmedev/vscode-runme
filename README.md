# [Runme](http://runme.dev) for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

This VS Code extension transparently opens markdown files (i.e. README.md) as runnable VS Code notebooks (with the click of a `play` button). Annotating markdown code blocks repo maintainers can enhance the interactive runbook-like experience of their markdown notebooks while they will continue to render properly in markdown viewers.

This project is open source licensed under APL2.0 and its code can be found in the following repos:

- [stateful/vscode-runme](https://github.com/stateful/vscode-runme)
- [stateful/runme](https://github.com/stateful/runme)
- [stateful/runme.dev](https://github.com/stateful/runme.dev)

Feel free to submit any issues you may have via the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/stateful/vscode-runme/issues) or [tell us about it on Discord](https://discord.gg/BQm8zRCBUY).

# Installation

- Install from the [VS Code marketplace website](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stateful.runme)
- Search for `runme` in the VS Code marketplace or extensions panel
- Be on the cutting edge and [download the latest release](https://github.com/stateful/vscode-runme/releases)

# Usage

After cloning into a repo in VS Code, open any markdown file and notice that instead of opening the markdown file content, in renders a notebook where shell commands are rendered as runnable blocks.

If you don't want the runme notebook, you can always right click on the .md file, click `Open With...` and select the text editor.

## Elevated Notebook Experience

Code blocks with `sh` or `bash` designators will result in executable notebook cells.

<pre>```sh
ls -al #some executable command here
```
</pre>

Auto-detection for will be applied to blocks without language designators. Runme however prefers to add language designators to all code blocks.

<pre>```
echo "block without language designation"
```
</pre>

Run in the background, great for compilers/bundler with file watchers.

<pre>```sh { background=true }
ls -al #some executable command here
```
</pre>

Notebook cells will launch a task inside of the terminal panel by default to allow for user-input. However, if code blocks do not require user interactivity it is possible to run them inline.

<pre>```sh { interactive=false }
ls -al #some executable command here
```
</pre>

Environment variables which are unbound (i.e. need user input) will prompt users for input. Quoted values will be prepopulated as placeholder value whereas unquoted values will be displayed as prompt message with empty value.

<pre>
```sh { interactive=false }
echo "Allows to make execution generic"
export PATH="$HOME/your/bin:$PATH"
export MY_PROJECT_PROMPT=Enter project name
export MY_PROJECT_VALUE="my-project-id"
echo $MY_PROJECT_PROMPT $MY_PROJECT_VALUE
```
</pre>

Please see [runme.dev's README.md](https://github.com/stateful/runme.dev/blob/main/README.md) for a reference how to apply these code block attributes in different use-cases.

## Interactive Service integrations

Runme strives to break out of the terminal without losing interoperability with the CLI to document how the your repo ties together an array for external services. To showcase how this works take a look at the GIF below or run through [Runme.dev's website README](https://github.com/stateful/runme.dev/blob/main/README.md).

![Deep Deno integration](https://staging.runme.dev/tabs/deno.gif)

What's happening is whenever Deno's `deployctl deploy` command is executed to deploy a Deno site from within a notebook cell (just a markdown code block), Runme will render an interactive deployment status based on the `$DENO_PROJECT_NAME` and `$DENO_ACCESS_TOKEN` provided in the notebook (will prompt for values otherwise).

```sh
export DENO_INSTALL="$HOME/.deno"
export PATH="$DENO_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"
export DENO_PROJECT_NAME="your-deno-project"
export DENO_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-deno-token"
```

```sh
cd ../runme.dev
deployctl deploy \
    --project=$DENO_PROJECT_NAME \
    --exclude=node_modules \
    --import-map=../runme.dev/import_map.json \
    --token=$DENO_ACCESS_TOKEN \
    main.ts
```

Let us know what services you rely on so we can add them to Runme's roadmap.

## How it works

Runme currently consists of a Markdown processor (written in Go) which is both linked in this VS Code extension (via WebAssembly) and the [runme CLI](https://github.com/stateful/runme) (Go binary) allowing for a consistent experience. The Runme VS Code extension leverages the notebook APIs to transparently provide an interactive user experience on top of static markdown.

## Bleeding edge software

Runme is pre-beta software that is under heavy development. Here are a few known limitations:

- Notebooks are currently read-only from within the notebook UX, please edit markdown file directly
- Only shell is currently supported on macOS & Linux, no PowerShell and Windows yet
- Be aware of edge cases. Runme still needs to continue maturing. Let us know when you hit any snags.

We would love to hear feedback, appreciate your patience, as Runme continutes to harden. Get in touch please!
