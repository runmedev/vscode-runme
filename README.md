# [Runme](http://runme.dev) for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) [![Tests](https://github.com/stateful/vscode-runme/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/stateful/vscode-runme/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This VS Code extension transparently opens markdown files (i.e. README.md) as runnable VS Code notebooks (with the click of a `play` button). Annotating markdown code blocks repo maintainers can enhance the interactive runbook-like experience of their markdown notebooks while they will continue to render properly in markdown viewers. Runme is [open source](https://docs.runme.dev/open-source) and licensed under APL2.0.

> ðŸ’¡ If you don't want the runme notebook, you can always right click on the .md file, click `Open With...` and select the text editor. To make your choice permanent pick "Configure default editor for...".

## Configure Cell Execution

Runme allows code blocks to be annotated with attributes to provide control over some aspects of execution, output, interaction, and other behavior. Please find a complete list in the [docs](https://docs.runme.dev/configuration#cell-level-options).

For instance, the following annotation will run the command in the background, great for compilers/bundler with file watchers. To enable or disable any of the available options just click the respective cell's `Configure` button.

    ```sh { background=true }
    npx tsc --watch
    ```

## Configure Document-level Execution
RUNME does not just retain frontmatter, it supports top-level settings that will affect all cells in the document.

```
---
shell: bash
# or
shell: zsh
# or
shell: /bin/ksh
---
```

Check the complete list of configuration options at https://docs.runme.dev/configuration or take a look at the [examples](https://github.com/stateful/vscode-runme/tree/main/examples) which are also illustrated in [Runme's integration docs](https://docs.runme.dev/integrations).
