Runme is primary a VS Code extension that provides developers with the ability to navigate workflows centered around code repositories by making Readme markdown files interactive and smart.

It allows you to run excutable scripts within a Notebook interface, give it a try:

```sh {"id":"01HF7B0KJDG9R0YG2H980BAF6P","interactive":"false"}
echo "Hello Runme!"
```

Awesome! ðŸŽ‰

It also persist your session state, so all environment variables stay around, e.g.:

```sh {"id":"01HF7B0KJDG9R0YG2H9A8M9B3D"}
export RUNME_MESSAGE="<input message here>"
```

now run:

```sh {"id":"01HF7B0KJDG9R0YG2H9B675FB7","interactive":"false"}
echo $RUNME_MESSAGE
```

Nice! ðŸ‘Œ
