# Why Runme?

Thank you for interest in Runme ðŸ’Ÿ!

Runme is a human-centric approach to providing and consuming code repository documentation. It's designed to progressively bridge the widening developer experience gaps in a cloud-native age. Gaps such as low integration between building blocks employed to deliver apps and services, error-prone copy&paste-management of dev environments, docs that have fallen behind undetect, and the vault lines of commonplace tools which were designed for machines not humans.

## ðŸŒˆ Runme will let you

- Easily onramp via your existing README.md (any markdown docs) with zero changes
- Intuitively run your commands (shell) in a notebook UX inside your IDE
- Alternatively the `runme` CLI is available for power users
- Curate developer experiences using Runme's subtle command block annotations
- Use commonplace git workflows to continuously improve your docs, just like code
- Continue to display your docs in Markdown-compatible viewers

## ðŸ›£ What's on the roadmap

- Coming soon ðŸ”¥! Authoring/editing inside of notebook UX
- Just like code, test your documentation in Continiuous Integration
- Switch back and forth between notebook and terminal UX seamlessly
- Notebook UX tweaks and integrations for both authors and users
- And more - tell us about your feature request [on Discord](https://discord.gg/stateful)
