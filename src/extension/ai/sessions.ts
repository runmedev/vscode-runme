// SessionManager is responsible for managing sessions of the AI requests.
// A session consists of multiple requests/operations that are all related.
// Currently, a session corresponds to a user setting the focus on a cell and
// editing that cell. The purpose of the session manager is to assign a unique
// id to a session and keep track of the current session. This way we can use
// the session id to correlate requests. In particular, for each session we only
// need to send the entire notebook once and then on subsequent events just send
// diffs.
//
// There is a single instance of the SessionManager that is accessed by the getManager
// function. This is because we need a single global session id that multiple callers
// can access.
//
// N.B. Currently we assume there is only one session at a time. Notably, we don't allow
// for multiple sessions to be active corresponding to different notebooks. A new session
// is activated when ever the cell focus changes so whenever a user switches to a different
// notebook we will start a new session. However, the old notebook might still have some
// ghost cells in it.
